      <span class="bio-p about-p">
        We are a group of young artists who want to promote classical music that celebrates the work of women and
        non-binary composers and poets. <i>Sappho: Tell Everyone</i> is our inaugural event. This website presentation
        of Sappho: Tell everyone is offered so that audience members who are homebound or not located physically near
        the concert space can also enjoy hearing new works and stories.</span>

      <span id="subheading">WHO IS SAPPHO, AND WHY ARE HER POEMS IN FRAGMENTS?</span>
      <span class="bio-p about-p">
        Sappho was an archaic Greek poet from the Isle of Lesbos who was known to be one of the greatest poets of her
        time. Very little is known about her, other than that she was born in Lesbos to an aristocratic family. </span>
      <span class="bio-p about-p">It is thought that Sappho composed about 10,000 lines of poetry in her life. A great
        deal of
        her poetry has been lost, and the pieces that survive exist only in fragments.
      </span>

    <div id="about">
      <span id="subheading">WHAT IS SAPPHO: TELL EVERYONE?</span>
      <span class="bio-p about-p">In the fall of 2021, artistic director Nicole Ross was reading a lot of Sappho and
        would often
        pair fragments together imagining that they would create a scene. She enjoyed changing up the order of the
        fragments to explore the many stories that could arise even by changing the placement of a few words. Later that
        year, Nicole consulted Grace Skehan, and the two of them finalized a list of fragments made into scenes that
        explore themes of love, loss, shame, revenge and celebration. With the help of a Canada Council for the Arts
        Grant, we were able to commission Danika Lorèn to set these to music.</span>
      <span class="bio-p about-p">A note from composer Danika Lorèn:</span>
      <span class="bio-p about-p"><i>Sappho’s texts are so moving without music, and the potent simplicity of her words
          is what
          I focused on in my musical interpretation. This is most clearly evoked in the vulnerable intensity of many a
          cappella vocal lines and improvisatory moments, the sparse, single-hand piano texture that is also meant to
          represent a lyre, and the way voices intermingle in a largely treble sound world. In these songs I hope to
          create a place for the queer feminine to live and be celebrated in/through classical music; for it to be truly
          seen for all of its intensity, its sincerity and its sweetness.</i></span>
      <span class="bio-p about-p">The <a href="vase.html">Explore Project</a> tab of the website allows you to
        experience the
        composition in many
        different ways. The piece has 11 movements, which you can find on tiles of the vase in the order of the Greek
        Alphabet. You can also "Choose-Your-Own-Adventure" of the piece by selecting movements in any order you
        like.</span>
      <span class="bio-p about-p">The unconventional presentation of this piece evokes the inherently fragmented and
        ambiguous
        nature of Sappho's work and supports a multiplicity of interpretations, allowing viewers to foster their own
        ongoing interpretation and re-interpretation with each viewing.</span>
